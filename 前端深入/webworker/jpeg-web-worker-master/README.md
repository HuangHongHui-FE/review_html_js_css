# jpeg-web-worker
Generate a jpeg (or png) using a web worker

## Motivation
The browser can generate a jpeg for you from an HTML canvas:

```
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var img    = canvas.toDataURL("image/jpg");
```
Which you can write to an image tag using:
```
document.write('<img src="'+img+'"/>');
```
or create as a blob (which can be sent as a part of a form) using:
```
var blob = canvas.toBlob( callback , 'image/jpeg' );
```

But what if the `toDataURL ` or `toBlob` call takes too long. Maybe the image is large or you are performing this call many times on different canvases. It would be nice to have the heavy duty of converting the canvas data to a jpeg off of the main application process. Perhaps through a web worker. This library provides the web worker file.

## Usage

**If you're working in the browser**
Getting the web worker file out of npm modules to be used by browser can be tricky. You can either copy the index.js into your project directory directly and rename it. Or you can use [workerify](https://github.com/shama/workerify) to convert this module to a blob to be used with browserify.

**API**

The message to be posted
```
{
  image: {
    data: [An RGBA array. This can typically be created by a canvas's context.getImageData],
    height: [Integer],
    width: [Integer]
  },
  quality: [OPTIONAL, defaults to 50. Integer from 0 (low quality) - 100 (high quality)]
}
```

The message to be received
```
{
  data: {
    data: [An RGBA Uint8Array, this time in JPEG encoding. Can be used to generate a jpeg blob.],
    height: [Integer],
    width: [Integer]
  }
}
```

**Example**

```
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var context = canvas.getContext('2d');
var imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
var worker = new Worker('jpeg-web-worker.js');
worker.postMessage({
  image: imageData,
  quality: 50
});
worker.onmessage = function(e) {
  // e.data is the imageData of the jpeg. {data: U8IntArray, height: int, width: int}
  // you can still convert the jpeg imageData into a blog like this:
  var blob = new Blob( [e.data.data], {type: 'image/jpeg'} );
}
```

**PNG Support**
```
worker.postMessage({
  image: imageData,
  png: true,
  quality: 50
});
worker.onmessage = function(e) {
  // Make sure to specify the type as png.
  var blob = new Blob( [e.data.data], {type: 'image/png'} );
}
```

## Credits

This library relies almost entirely on an adaptation of the encoder from the [jpeg-js]() library. This library was built to work in a node.js environment and not in the browser, let alone in a web worker environment.

The png part of this library is pulled directly from https://github.com/photopea/UPNG.js
