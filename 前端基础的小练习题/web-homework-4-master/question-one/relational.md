You should make it clear which attributes in your relational model are primary keys and foreign keys. To do this, use the following conventions (check the source view):

| |           |  
|----|-----------|
| Primary keys | **bold**  |
| Foreign keys | _italics_ |

For example:

entityName(**primaryKey**, attribute, _foreignKey_)

---

TODO:

artists(**names**, phone number, Country of origin, store with a 2 letter code)

companies(**names**, descriptions)

songs(**names**, number of sales)

genres(**name**, description)
